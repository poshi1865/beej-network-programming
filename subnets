An IPV4 address has 2 parts: Network and Host.

Class A: 1 byte network and 3 bytes host.
Class B: 2 bytes network and 2 bytes host.
Class C: 3 bytes network and 1 byte host.

For example, if 192.0.2.12 is a class C address, the network address is 192.0.2 and the Host portion is 12.

The network portion of the IP address is generally described by something called as a 'netmask'.

    netmask           AND     ip_address    =    network number

    255.255.255.0     AND     192.0.2.12    =    192.0.2.0

    Unfortunately, it turned out that this wasnâ€™t fine-grained enough for the eventual needs of the Internet; 
    We were running out of Class C networks quite quickly, and we were most definitely out of Class As.
    To remedy this, The Powers That Be allowed for the netmask to be an arbitrary number of bits, not just 8, 16, or 24.
    So you might have a netmask of, say 255.255.255.252, which is 30 bits of network, and 2 bits of host allowing for four hosts on the network.
    (Note that the netmask is ALWAYS a bunch of 1-bits followed by a bunch of 0-bits.)
    
    New Style:
    You just put a slash after the IP address, and then follow that by the number of network bits in decimal. Like this: 192.0.2.12/30.
